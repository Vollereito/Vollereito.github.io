However, I know many people don’t write, and many who want to write don’t know what to write about. This blog post intends to change that!我写了很多。我很少公开分享我写的东西，但无论如何我写了很多，我认为这是我最重要的习惯之一。但是，我知道很多人不写，很多想写的不知道写什么。这篇博文旨在改变这一点！\nWhy write?To cope and reflect 应对与反思I write because writing helps me deal with life. Talking to friends is always helpful for getting through hard times, but sometimes friends are busy, or I don’t want to bother them, or I don’t feel comfortable talking about something in particular. In an especially difficult time, I might not feel I even have close friends to begin with. This is when writing helps; a journal will never not listen to you. I can vent on paper without fear of being judged, and as I vocalize my thoughts and feelings, I can begin to make sense of things. My words might be a barrage of nonsense and emotion as I first begin to write, but once they’re on paper, I can begin to organize my thoughts. What’s ticking me off? Why? What can I do to handle the situation?我写作是因为写作帮助我应对生活。和朋友倾诉总是有助于渡过难关，但有时朋友很忙，或者我不想打扰他们，或者我不太愿意谈论一些特别的事情。在特别困难的时候，我可能一开始就觉得我什至没有亲密的朋友。这是写作有帮助的时候；期刊永远不会不听你的。我可以在纸上发泄而不用担心被评判，当我说出自己的想法和感受时，我可以开始理解事物。刚开始写作时，我的话可能是一连串的废话和情绪，但一旦它们写在纸上，我就可以开始整理我的想法。是什么让我讨厌？为什么？我能做些什么来处理这种情况？\nThis kind of thinking also helps me maximize my time. In reflecting often, I’m quick to identify what’s most meaningful to me, as well as what’s just wasting energy. Instead of blindingly following life for a decade and then wondering where the time went, this helps me be more intentional in what I do.这种想法也有助于我最大限度地利用时间。通过经常反思，我很快就能确定什么对我最有意义，以及什么只是在浪费精力。与其盲目地追随生活十年，然后想知道时间都去哪儿了，这有助于我在做事时更有目的性。\nTo rememberI write so I have something to look back on. I’m all for moving forward and not getting stuck in the past, but I also like to be able to see where I’ve been. It’s good to remember what the happy times felt like, and, likewise, it’s good to remember what it was like to struggle. It’s good to be able to see what I’ve done and how far I’ve come. It helps keep life in perspective.我写作是为了让我有一些东西可以回顾。我完全赞成前进而不是停留在过去，但我也希望能够看到我去过的地方。记住快乐时光的感觉很好，同样，记住奋斗的感觉也很好。很高兴能够看到我做了什么以及我走了多远。它有助于保持正确的生活。\nI also write to keep memories alive. When I’m an old fart and can only eat, poop, and tell stories, I better have some damn good stories to tell.我也写信来保持记忆。等我老了，只会吃饭拉屎讲故事的时候，还是有一些该死的好故事讲吧。\nTo make decisions 做决定When at a crossroads, I write. For example, when I was a high school senior debating on which college to attend, I wrote to help myself make up my mind. I wrote down all of the factors I value in my college experience and ordered them by importance; then I wrote down all of my options, and wrote down how well each option would achieve what I value, and the problems I might have with each option. (For what it’s worth, I’m pretty satisfied with the route I ended up choosing.) Not only does this help me make well thought-out decisions, but having my decision on paper helps me make up my mind and move on, instead of changing my mind every day.在十字路口，我写作。例如，当我还是一名高中生时，正在考虑上哪所大学，我写信帮助自己下定决心。我写下了我在大学经历中看重的所有因素，并按重要性排序；然后我写下了我所有的选择，并写下了每个选项实现我的价值的程度，以及每个选项可能遇到的问题。 （对于它的价值，我对我最终选择的路线非常满意。）这不仅帮助我做出深思熟虑的决定，而且将我的决定写在纸上有助于我下定决心并继续前进，而不是每天改变我的想法。\nTo practiceWriting helps me become a better communicator. That may be obvious, but it’s worth saying. In writing – whether that be journaling, venting, pontificating, or anything else – you practice shaping abstract feelings and ideas into concrete words.写作帮助我成为更好的沟通者。这可能是显而易见的，但值得一提。在写作中——无论是写日记、发泄、自以为是，还是其他任何事情——你练习将抽象的感受和想法转化为具体的文字。\nWriting enables you to share experiences with others in a powerful way; through your words, others can connect with you and come to understand how you feel. Think of your favorite books and movies; often, what makes these powerful is that a reader or viewer can connect on a deep level with characters and really stand in a character’s shoes. It may sound sappy, but I think there is something to be said for learning to show others your world. How does it feel to deal with rejection from the job you wanted so badly? To reject the most qualified applicant to a job posting because of company politics? How does it feel to manage the disappointment of parents? To be a disappointed parent yourself? How does it feel to struggle in a class where the material is foreign, the professor can’t teach, and the TA is rude? How does it feel to TA for a class where the material is challenging, the professor can’t teach, and you’re so overwhelmed with life – your own grades are suffering and a parent just passed away – that you feel like you’re snapping at everyone?写作使您能够以有力的方式与他人分享经验；通过您的言语，其他人可以与您建立联系并了解您的感受。想想你最喜欢的书和电影；通常，这些作品之所以强大，是因为读者或观众可以与人物建立深层次的联系，并真正站在人物的立场上。这听起来可能很傻，但我认为学习向他人展示你的世界是有道理的。面对你非常想要的工作被拒绝感觉如何？由于公司政治而拒绝最合格的求职者？处理父母的失望感觉如何？自己做一个失望的父母？在材料是外国的，教授不会教，助教很粗鲁的课堂上挣扎是什么感觉？对于一门内容具有挑战性、教授无法教授、你对生活如此不知所措——你自己的成绩很差，父母刚刚去世——你觉得自己是对着所有人发火？\nYou might write many narratives that you don’t or can’t share with others. However, in writing them, you improve in your ability to channel emotions into words and help others understand how you feel.你可能会写很多你不会或不能与他人分享的故事。然而，在写下它们时，您可以提高将情绪转化为文字的能力，并帮助他人理解您的感受。\nEven if you aren’t interested in narratives, practicing writing can help you express your thoughts and convince others of your opinions. In writing, your first few words might be, “that political view is stupid.” Then, as you continue to write, you figure out how to vocalize precisely why it is wrong. You move past saying “I don’t like that guy,” introspect, and figure out why exactly you don’t like him, and whether anything could be improved. You learn to express yourself, share your perspectives, and work with others more constructively than you would otherwise.即使您对叙述不感兴趣，练习写作也可以帮助您表达自己的想法并说服他人接受您的观点。在写作中，您的前几句话可能是“那种政治观点很愚蠢”。然后，当你继续写作时，你会想出如何准确地说出错误的原因。你不再说“我不喜欢那个人”，反省，找出你不喜欢他的确切原因，以及是否有任何可以改进的地方。你学会表达自己，分享你的观点，并以比其他方式更有建设性的方式与他人合作。\nTo help others 帮助别人Structured writing can often be of use to others; for example, I write this blog in the hopes that someone might find a tutorial or explanation useful. However, your ramblings and rants about how life is going can be helpful as well, even if you don’t share them with anyone!结构化写作通常对其他人有用；例如，我写这个博客是希望有人能找到有用的教程或解释。但是，即使您不与任何人分享，您对生活进展的漫谈和咆哮也会有所帮助！\nUnstructured ramblings help later on when you are giving advice to someone in a hard time that you previously went through. It’s often unhelpful, or perhaps even dangerous, to give advice when you don’t remember what it was like to be in that situation. Generally, you either know what it’s like to be in the situation (because you are in it) or you know how things turned out afterwards, but not both. We don’t usually remember (in detail) hard times; theories of motivated forgetting suggest we tend to forget difficult memories, and studies on “rosy retrospection” find that we often remember the past as more positive than we experienced it. When someone asks for advice on a tough situation that we went through in the past, we often can’t do much more than offer our thoughts in retrospect, just as anyone might do – unless we wrote down what it was like to go through that time!当你在你之前经历过的困难时期向某人提供建议时，非结构化的漫谈会有所帮助。当您不记得在那种情况下是什么样子时，提供建议通常是无益的，甚至可能是危险的。通常，您要么知道在这种情况下的感觉（因为您身处其中），要么您知道事后的结果，但不是两者都知道。我们通常不会（详细地）记得困难时期；动机性遗忘理论表明，我们往往会忘记困难的记忆，而对“美好回顾”的研究发现，我们常常会认为过去比我们经历过的更积极。当有人就我们过去经历过的艰难处境征求意见时，我们通常只能回顾一下我们的想法，就像任何人都可能做的那样——除非我们写下经历那段经历的感受时间！\nIn high school, I struggled a lot with self worth, deciding where to go to college, connecting with other people, and plenty else. When someone asks me for help with these things, I always first look to what I wrote. What did it feel like to go through those times? What helped me? How did I eventually make it through? What do I wish someone told me? Because I wrote, I remember what it was like to go through those times, and, perhaps more importantly, I remember what it was like to make it out.在高中时，我在自我价值、决定去哪里上大学、与他人建立联系等等方面苦苦挣扎。当有人向我寻求帮助时，我总是先看看我写的东西。经历那些时光是什么感觉？对我有什么帮助？我最终是如何度过难关的？我希望有人告诉我什么？因为我写了，所以我记得经历那些时光是什么感觉，也许更重要的是，我记得挺身而出的感觉。\nWhat should I write about? 我应该写些什么？Anything you want. Any writing can be helpful writing. However, these are some things to get you started:任何你想要的。任何写作都可以是有帮助的写作。但是，以下是一些可以帮助您入门的事情：\nWrite about your day. As I mentioned, I do this often when I’m going through a hard time. I’ll just write down something that happened, and then I’ll write down my thoughts as they come to mind. These often end up as long rants. That’s okay. I try to write about happy days as well, but I usually have less motivation to do that :)写下你的一天。正如我提到的，当我遇到困难时，我经常这样做。我会写下发生的事情，然后写下我想到的想法。这些通常以长篇大论告终。没关系。我也试着写快乐的日子，但我通常没有动力去做那件事:)Write about something you read. Are there any new or notable ideas? How do you feel about it? What’s your response? Last night, I read an article about some folks teaching a CS 101 class as an actual music class that also covered CS fundamentals. I had never heard of this, so I wrote down some key takeaways and my opinions on the approach.写下你读过的东西。有什么新的或值得注意的想法吗？你怎么看这件事？你的回应是什么？昨晚，我读了一篇文章，内容是关于一些人将 CS 101 课程作为实际的音乐课程进行教学，其中还涵盖了 CS 基础知识。我从来没有听说过这个，所以我写下了一些关键要点和我对这种方法的看法。Write about an idea that has been bugging you. Sometimes I write about politics. Sometimes I write about philosophical ideas that have been on my mind. Sometimes I write about an idea related to computer science education, or I write about my brothers, or I reflect on how I feel life is going in general. It could be anything I’ve been thinking about. Sometimes I’ll write down what I was thinking about in the shower.写下一个困扰你的想法。有时我写政治。有时我会写一些一直在我脑海中的哲学思想。有时我会写一个与计算机科学教育相关的想法，或者我写我的兄弟们，或者我反思我对生活的总体感受。这可能是我一直在想的任何事情。有时我会写下我在淋浴时的想法。Write a story. Pick something that happened recently, and then describe it in vivid detail. Who was there? What did the expressions on their faces look like? How did it feel to be there? Who was wearing what? Was it a beautiful day out, with the wind blowing and the sun shining just the right amount? Or did things happen indoors? Was the room well-lit, or dim and musty? Try to write such that someone else could live the experience through your words.写一个故事。挑出最近发生的一件事情，然后生动详细地描述它。那时谁在那里？他们脸上的表情是什么样的？在那里感觉如何？谁穿了什么？这是美好的一天吗，微风轻拂，阳光照耀得恰到好处？或者事情发生在室内？房间光线充足，还是昏暗且有霉味？尝试这样写，以便其他人可以通过您的文字体验这种体验。How should I write? 我应该怎么写？Some people prefer writing with paper and pen. Some studies indicate that writing by hand may help you to be more creative. Personally, I much prefer typing; I have hyperhidrosis, which makes writing on paper difficult, and I can type over 3x faster than I can write by hand. (Yes, I actually timed that… ¯_(ツ)&#x2F;¯) Try both, and do whatever works best for you. I use Day One on my Mac and Google Keep on my phone.有些人更喜欢用纸和笔书写。一些研究表明，手写可以帮助您更有创造力。就个人而言，我更喜欢打字；我有多汗症，这使得在纸上书写变得困难，而且我打字的速度比手写快 3 倍以上。 （是的，我实际上是这样计时的……¯(ツ)_&#x2F;¯）两者都试试，做最适合你的。我在 Mac 上使用 Day One，在手机上使用 Google Keep。\nPeople also have different opinions about whether or not you should listen to music while writing. If I have a lot in my head that I’m bursting to get on paper, then I’ll often write without music, but I find that if I’m tired and don’t feel like writing, listening to music can help me get into the zone. I always choose music without lyrics – simple electronic or orchestral music with a strong beat but without anything distracting seems to work best for me – but your mileage may vary.对于写作时是否应该听音乐，人们也有不同的看法。如果我脑子里有很多东西急着要写在纸上，那么我会经常在没有音乐的情况下写作，但我发现如果我累了不想写作，听音乐可以帮助我进入该区域。我总是选择没有歌词的音乐——简单的电子音乐或管弦乐，节奏强劲但没有任何分散注意力的音乐似乎最适合我——但你的里程可能会有所不同。\nSometimes outlining helps. Sometimes I don’t have time to write things out in full, so I’ll write down points I want to talk about, order them, and then expand them into full writings. Other times I just dive in.有时概述会有所帮助。有时候没时间写完整，就把想说的地方写下来，整理一下，再扩充成完整的文章。其他时候我只是潜入。\nA common excuse is “oh, I don’t have time to write.” If you’re a busy person, set aside just ten minutes each day to write. Just ten minutes will make a difference! If you can’t even spare ten minutes, you might want to think about how you’re spending your time…一个常见的借口是“哦，我没有时间写”。如果你是一个忙碌的人，每天只留出十分钟来写作。只要十分钟就会有不同！如果你连十分钟都抽不出，你可能想想想你是如何打发时间的……\nI think the most important thing is to simply find a place where you won’t be disturbed, silence your phone or disable notifications on your computer, and just go at it. Don’t worry about what anyone thinks. You don’t need to share your writing; you write for you. It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t sound good. It doesn’t matter if there are spelling and grammatical mistakes all over. Just write!我认为最重要的是简单地找到一个不会被打扰的地方，将手机静音或禁用计算机上的通知，然后就去做吧。不要担心任何人的想法。你不需要分享你的作品；你为你而写。听起来不好也没关系。到处都是拼写和语法错误都没关系。写吧！\n","slug":"Write","date":"2023-04-17T23:03:18.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"Aurora"},{"id":"b9663f58f18133b35bfe243f3e916a80","title":"Hello World","content":"Welcome to Hexo!

I’ve long considered starting to write something, but I never knew what to write about. It often feels like every problem in technology has been adequately explained on other people’s blogs, and better than I can explain it. However, sometimes this is not always the case. Often, I have to do multiple searches to find out what the problem is. Sometimes, after spending hours searching, I cobble together a solution that doesn’t appear on anyone’s blog, describes a problem, or solves a problem. I realized that I could write about exactly those things.\nOf course, anyone with a brain can solve a problem on their own, but by keeping a blog, I might save some time for people in the future. I also found that writing helped me keep track of the problems I had solved and helped others better understand what I was spending my time doing. I always struggle with interview questions like “Tell me about some of the challenges you’ve had on this project” or “What was the most difficult mistake you’ve dealt with” because I unfortunately tend to forget what I’ve done. Start doing the next thing. Yes!\nThis blog serves as a record of some of the things I’ve done, and I just need to read what I’ve written to refresh my mind. Perhaps my biggest objection to blogging is that I don’t think I have enough time to write about it. As it happens, that’s still an objection. I plan to write every chance I get, but this blog is as much an experiment as anything else. I tried to build my blog with Jekyll and Octopress 3, but it was really more difficult to get started than Hexo, although I may try others later.\nI used Hexo’s Next theme (elegant) and it’s actually not worse than Jekyll at all. So, now I have a blog.\n正如你所看到的，我开了一个博客。我早就考虑开始写点东西，但我从来不知道该写什么。常常感觉科技中的每一个问题都已经在其他人的博客上得到了充分的解释，而且比我解释地的还要好。然而，有时候的情况并非总是如此。很多时候，我必须做多次搜索才能找出问题所在。有时，在花几个小时搜索之后，我拼凑出一个没有在任何人的博客上出现过的， 描述一个问题，或解决一个问题的方案。我意识到，我可以写的正是这些东西。\n当然，任何有头脑的人都可以自己解决问题，但通过保留博客，我可能会为未来的人们节省一些时间。我还发现写作可以帮助我跟踪我已经解决的问题，并帮助其他人更好地了解我花时间做的事情。我总是纠结于“告诉我你在这个项目中遇到的一些挑战”或“你处理过的最困难的错误是什么”这样的面试问题，因为我很不幸地倾向于忘记我做过的事情。开始做接下来的事情。是的！\n这个博客可以作为我做过的一些事情的记录，我只需要阅读我写的东西来刷新我的想法。也许我对写博客最大的反对是我觉得我没有足够的时间来写它。碰巧，这仍然是一个反对意见。我计划一有机会就写，但这个博客和其他任何东西一样都是一个实验。我尝过试过用 Jekyll 和 Octopress 3来搭建我的博客，但是它确实是比Hexo更加难以上手，虽然我以后可能会尝试其它。\n我使用 了 Hexo 的 Next 主题（优雅），它实际上一点也不比Jekyll差。所以，现在我有一个博客了。\n","slug":"start","date":"2023-04-12T01:01:49.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"Aurora"}]
